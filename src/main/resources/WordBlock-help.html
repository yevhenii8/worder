<h2>Command Line Interface</h2>
<p>Initially, Worder was a Java CLI application, then a Kotlin CLI application. As for now it's a GUI one :) But utilizing CLI is still the most
    convenient and a very handy way to choose a resolution for WordBlocks. Some important notes here are: </p>
<ul>
    <li>CLI is only connected to the current NO_RESOLUTION block.</li>
    <li>When first resolution received, you can only change it through GUI.</li>
</ul>

<p>The intended way of using CLI is the next: you choose DEF (definition(s)), EXP (example(s)) and then CLI sets WordBlock's resolution to UPDATED.
    You can select from proposed options (using their indexes) or from the custom ones. Also, you can combine proposed and custom in any way.</p>
<dl>
    <dt>Possible ways to choose definition(s) - DEF?</dt>
    <dd>
        <ol>
            <li>Two proposed: (i1 i2) -> (ENTER)</li>
            <li>Two custom: (c1) -> (ENTER) -> (c2) -> (ENTER)</li>
            <li>Only proposed: (i1) -> (ENTER) -> (ENTER)</li>
            <li>Only custom: (c1) -> (ENTER) -> (ENTER)</li>
            <li>Proposed and custom: (i1) -> (ENTER) -> (c1) -> (ENTER)</li>
            <li>Custom and proposed: (c1) -> (ENTER) -> (i1) -> (ENTER)</li>
        </ol>
    </dd>

    <dt>Possible ways to choose example(s) - EXP?</dt>
    <dd>
        <ol>
            <li>No example: (ENTER)</li>
            <li>One or more proposed: (i1 i2 i3 ... in) -> (ENTER) -> (ENTER)</li>
            <li>One or more custom: (c1) -> (ENTER) -> (c2) -> (ENTER) -> ... -> (ENTER) -> (ENTER)</li>
            <li>Proposed and custom: (i1) -> (ENTER) -> (c1) -> (ENTER) -> ... -> (ENTER) -> (ENTER)</li>
            <li>Custom and proposed: (c1) -> (ENTER) -> (i1) -> (ENTER) -> ... -> (ENTER) -> (ENTER)</li>
        </ol>
    </dd>

    <dt>At any moment (DEF or EXP stages) you can set another resolution or ask for help:</dt>
    <dd>
        <ol>
            <li>--remove -> immediately sets Removed resolution</li>
            <li>--learn -> immediately sets Learned resolution</li>
            <li>--skip -> immediately sets Skipped resolution</li>
            <li>--help -> displays this help message</li>
        </ol>
    </dd>
</dl>


<h2>Update Tab Guide</h2>
<p>To update a word means to pick up a non-updated word from your database, request all possible transcriptions, definitions and examples from the
    present Requesters. Then to compose a WordBlock which allows you to choose definitions and examples for the word and consequently update the word
    in database.</p>

<dl>
    <dt>Which words will Worder pick up for updating?</dt>
    <dd>
        <ol>
            <li>It doesn't not have worder's #updated Tag.</li>
            <li>Its rate &lt; 100, so it's unlearned word.</li>
            <li>It was not skipped in current session.</li>
        </ol>
    </dd>

    <dt>Can I configure pick-up criteria?</dt>
    <dd>As for now - No.</dd>

    <dt>Which actions are available for WordBlock?</dt>
    <dd>
        <ol>
            <li>Update</li>
            <li>Set Removed</li>
            <li>Set Learned</li>
            <li>Set Skipped</li>
        </ol>
    </dd>

    <dt>What I need to choose in order to update a word?</dt>
    <dd>
        <ol>
            <li>You have to choose only one (primary) definition. Secondary is optional.</li>
            <li>You can also choose zero or more (unlimited) count of examples.</li>
            <li>Transcription is picked up automatically, preferring the present one.</li>
        </ol>
    </dd>
</dl>
